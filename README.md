# 🚀 Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

👋 Oh hey there! You found my README. Nice. Grab a coffee ☕ and take a look around!  

I am **Victor**, a C++ developer who spends more time debugging than actually writing code. 😅

💻 **C++ | QT Developer | Occasional Bug Creator**  
🔍 Always exploring new ways to make my code ~~*less terrible*~~ more performatic!



## 🛠️ My Skills
- 🏎️ **C++** (Modern C++11/14/17/20) – because plain old C just wasn’t chaotic enough.
- 🎨 **Qt for GUI and Desktop Applications** – Making UIs that usually don’t crash.
- ⚡ **Performance Optimization** – Finding that one slow function and blaming it on the compiler. The processor it's never chill enough.
- 🏗️ **Design Patterns & Best Practices** – Because spaghetti belongs on a plate, not in my codebase.



## 📂 Projects
Here is where I showcase my ideas, you know, if I have time to start them. 

 - *WORKING IN PROGRESS.... COME BACK LATER*

🎉 Thanks for stopping by! Now, back to debugging... 🚀
